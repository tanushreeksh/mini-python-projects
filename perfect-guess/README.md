# Perfect Guess Game

A number guessing game written in Python. The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**, and the player must guess it within a limited number of attempts based on the chosen difficulty level.


## Features
Difficulty levels:
  - **Easy** → 15 attempts
  - **Medium** → 10 attempts
  - **Hard** → 5 attempts

- Hints provided:
  - "Higher number please" if the guess is too low
  - "Lower number please" if the guess is too high

- Replay option after each round


## How It Works
1. The player chooses a difficulty level.  
2. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
3. The player keeps guessing until they:
   - Find the correct number 
   - Or run out of attempts
