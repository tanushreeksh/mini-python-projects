## mini-python-projects

This repository is a curated collection of Python projects I’ve built to strengthen my core programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Each project focuses on applying clean logic, practical coding techniques, and hands-on learning.

# Projects so far

1.**Bank Management System** – JSON-based implementation of account management, deposits, withdrawals, and user data handling.

2.**Luna(Voice Assistant)** – A Python-based voice assistant capable of recognizing a wake word, executing basic commands like opening websites, and providing spoken feedback using text-to-speech.


Why I’m Doing This?

While tutorials are valuable for learning syntax, I believe active problem-solving is the fastest way to grow as a programmer. These mini-projects allow me to:

-Strengthen core logic and coding discipline

-Make mistakes and learn by debugging before tackling more advanced AI/ML projects

-Build a personal library of reference projects to revisit and improve over time

-Experiment with practical Python applications like file handling, voice recognition, and automation
