# mini-python-projects

This repository is a growing collection of small, focused Python projects I've been building to strengthen my core programming skills.

# Projects so far

1. Rock Paper Scissors (logic-based game using user input)
2. The Perfect Guess (guess-the-number with levels & attempts)

# Why I'm Doing This
While tutorials are helpful, I believe in **active problem-solving** as the fastest way to grow as a programmer. These mini-projects are my way of:
- Practicing clean logic 
- Making errors and learning from them
- Building muscle memory in Python before moving to advanced AI/ML projects
