# mini-python-projects

This repository is a curated collection of Python projects I’ve built to strengthen my core programming skills. Each project focuses on applying clean logic and hands-on learning.

## Projects so far

1.**Bank Management System** – JSON-based implementation of account management, deposits, withdrawals, and user data handling.

2.**Luna (Voice Assistant)** – Wake-word activated assistant; executes commands, plays music, fetches news, and uses text-to-speech.


### Purpose: Strengthen logic, experiment with automation and APIs, and build a hands-on Python portfolio for growth and reference.
